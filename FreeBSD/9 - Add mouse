drag and drop windows
resize windows
mousewheel


Add this to ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc

# Mouse pointer raises focus on window
~button1
    bspc pointer -g focus

# Mouse button to move and resize
super + shift + button{1-3}
    bspc pointer -g {move,resize_side,resize_corner}

super + shift + !button{1-3}
    bspc pointer -t %i %i

super + shift + @button{1-3}
    bspc pointer -u
    
    
How it works? ([super] = windows key)
Press " [super] + s " to switch a windows to float mode
Press " [super] + left " mouse to drag a window around
Press " [super] + right " to adjust a windows size (this is also possible withough [super])
Press " [super] + middle " to only adjust the height/length
