Sniff Packets with built in tools 
--------------------------------- 
 
 Start capturing/sniffing with:
 netsh trace start <parameters>
 
 
 and stop it with:
 netsh trace stop
 
 
 
 Example: netsh trace start capture=yes           <- Captures all traffic and saves it to a emp file
 
   The output is in the etl file format which you can analyze with
   the software "microsoft message analyzer"
