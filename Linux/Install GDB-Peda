 $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
 $ git clone https://github.com/longld/peda
 $ nano ~/.gdbinit # and add the following
 
 **
 # Source all settings from the peda dir
source ~/peda/peda.py
 
# These are other settings I have found useful
 
# Intel syntax is more readable
set disassembly-flavor intel
 
# When inspecting large portions of code the scrollbar works better than 'less'
set pagination off
 
 
# Keep a history of all the commands typed. Search is possible using ctrl-r
set history save on
set history filename ~/.gdb_history
set history size 32768
set history expansion on
**

$ nano peda/lib/config.py # and change the following

**
"debug"     : ("on", "show detail error of peda commands, e.g: on|off"),   # like you see we change it from off to on
**

Now we can run gdb and have peda installed
