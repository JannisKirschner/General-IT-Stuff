Test SQL connections with UDL files
----------------------------------

*With this trick you can test SQL connections (SQL Native, OLE and more) with ease*

-Rightclick on Desktop
-"New" -> textdocument
-Call it test.udl  (you can replace test with anything you'd like)
-Accept the message
-Doubleclick on it



Without this method you'd need to check it via ODBC or external tools
