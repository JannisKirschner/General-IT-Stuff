***I used the following solution for Ubuntu, so I'm not quite sure if it works on other distributions***

To change the keyboard layout/key mappings you can use the 
"loadkeys ch"  (ch for switzerland, de for germany, us for united states) command.

The better solution would be "sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration".
This command lets you completely reconfigure the default keyboard for the whole machine.
